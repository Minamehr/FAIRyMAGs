## Workflow Overview

This workflow preprocesses metagenomic data by organizing and concatenating paired-end reads into group-specific datasets based on metadata. These grouped datasets are prepared for subsequent co-assembly, enabling downstream analysis of group-level metagenomes.


## Change log

### Version 1.0

* Initial workflow setup.
* Grouping and concatenation of paired-end reads. 
* Organized output files for co-assembly.
